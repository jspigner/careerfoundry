Here is a SQL query with a common table expression (CTE): 

WITH category_name_cte (film_id, rating, category_name) AS 
  (SELECT A.film_id, 
          A.rating,
          C.name 
  FROM film A 
  LEFT JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id 
  LEFT JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C. category_id)
